# Movies-ETL

## Overview
The purpose of this deliverable is to combine 3 data sources (Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens ratings data) to come up with suggested movies for Amazing Prime to add to their collection of movies. To complete this process, we are utilizing an ETL (extract transform load) process to move the data from the csv and json files into a SQL data base utilizing pandas.

## Results

We were successfully able to ETL the data into a SQL database by using a function in python Jupyter Notebooks.
